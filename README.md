# Network Security Project

This repository contains the implementation of a network security application using Python, MongoDB, Docker, AWS, and other tools. The project includes data ingestion, validation, training pipelines, and deployment using cloud infrastructure.

---

## Overview

The Network Security Project is a scalable application designed to handle network security tasks, including data ingestion, validation, and machine learning pipelines for predictions. The system is integrated with cloud storage (AWS S3), Docker containers, and CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion and Validation**: Processes raw network data for security analysis.
- **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Trains and deploys models to detect anomalies in the network.
- **Cloud Integration**: Syncs with AWS S3 and deploys Docker containers to AWS ECR.
- **Frontend API**: Exposes APIs for batch predictions and training pipelines.
- **Logging and Exception Handling**: Provides robust logging and error management.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated builds and deployment via GitHub Actions.
